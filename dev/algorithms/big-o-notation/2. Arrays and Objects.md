## Objects
### When to use objects
- When you don't need order
- When you need fast access / insertion and removal

### Big O of Objects
- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Search - O(n)
- Access - O(1)
When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice!

## Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists.

### When to use arrays
- When you need order
- When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of...)
### Big O of Arrays
- Insertion - It depends
	- If inserting at the end of the array, it's O(1). If trying to insert an element at the beginning of the array, it's O(n).
- Removal - It depends
	- If removing from the end of the array, it's O(1). If removing from the beginning of the array, it's O(n).
- Searching - O(n)
- Access - O(1)

### Big O of Array Operations
- push - O(1)
- pop - O(1)
- shift - O(n)
- unshift - O(n)
- concat - O(n)
- slice - O(n)
- splice- O(n)
- sort - O(n * log<sub>n</sub>)
- forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc - O(n)
