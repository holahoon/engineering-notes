- Amazon EKS = Amazon Elastic **Kubernetes** Service
- It is a way to launch **managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS**
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized (usually Docker) application
- It's an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
- EKS supports **EC2** if you want to deploy worker nodes or **Fargate** to deploy serverless containers
- **Use case**: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic** (can be used in any cloud - Azure, GCP, ...)
