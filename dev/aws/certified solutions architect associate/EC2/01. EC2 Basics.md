EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering.
- EC2 stands for **Elastic Computing Cloud**, which is an infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works
## EC2 sizing & Configuration options
- Operating System(**OS**): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
- How much compute power & cores (**CPU**)
- How much random-access memory (**RAM**)
- How much storage space:
	- Network-attached (**EBS & EFS**)
	- hardware (**EC2 Instance Store**)
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: **security group**
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

## EC2 User Data
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- **bootstraping** means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is **only run once** at the instance **first start**
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates
	- Installing software
	- Downloading common files from the internet
	- Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

## EC2 Instance Types - Overview
- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases. [ref](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).
- AWS has the following naming convention: ex. `m5.2xlarge`
	- `m`: instance
	- `5`: generation (AWS improves them over time)
	- `2xlarge`: size within the instance class
### General Purpose
- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
	- Compute
	- Memory
	- Networking
- Here, we will be using `t2.micro` which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

### Compute Optimized
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
	- Batch processing workloads
	- Media transcoding
	- High performance web servers
	- High performance computing (HPC)
	- Scientific modeling & machine learning
	- Dedicated gaming servers

### Memory(RAM) Optimized
- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
	- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
	- Distributed web scale cache stores
	- In-memory databases optimized for BI(business intelligence)
	- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

### Storage Optimized
- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
	- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
	- Relational & NoSQL databases
	- Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
	- Data warehousing applications
	- Distributed file systems
