## WTH is SSH

The Secure Shell protocol is a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network.
SSH is one of the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command line.

Basically, from our own local machine, it will access over the web through `Port 22` and access the EC2 machine. The command line interface is going to be just as if we were inside that EC2 machine.

## Start SSH in MacOS

Make sure to download `pem` file by creating an EC2 instance from AWS. Also check to see if we allowed our Security Group to authorize Port 22 from 0.0.0.0/0.

Navigate to the directory where `pem` file is located and run:
```bash
$ ssh -i <pem name> <AMI user>@<Public IPv4 address>

# example
$ ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@52.90.109.49
```

- `EC2Tutorial.pem`: is the `pem` file download when creating the EC2 instance. Make sure there no spaces in the file name
- `ec2-user`: AWS linux 2 AMI has one user setup for us, named `ec2-user`
- `52.90.109.49`: is the Public IPv4 address of the EC2 instance.
	- *Keep in mind that the IP address will change it EC2 restarts*

When getting prompts or errors like:
```bash
The authenticity of host '52.90.109.49 (52.90.109.49)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:OTSXAoYh0kfnk44a24QecA6Nuebdg+J5nQM25KfaYEk.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? y
Please type 'yes', 'no' or the fingerprint: yes
```
Just type in `yes`.

```
Warning: Permanently added '52.90.109.49' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for 'EC2Tutorial.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "EC2Tutorial.pem": bad permissions
ec2-user@52.90.109.49: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
```
This is saying that we have unprotected key file, and need to change the permissions for it.
So run:
```bash
chmod 0400 <pem file name>
chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem
```
Then run the `ssh` command again and it will show something like:
```bash

📝 There's a guide on how to *connect to instance* on EC2 > Instances > <instance-id> > Connect to instance.

🤔 Also, keep in mind that the inbound rule MUST authorize SSH rule at Port 22 from anywhere IPv4(0.0.0.0/0) in order to connect. Or sometimes, you might be using IPv6, if so, allow this IP as well.
