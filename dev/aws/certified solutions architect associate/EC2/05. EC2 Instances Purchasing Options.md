There are different types of purchasing options in EC2 instances:
- **On-Demand Instances** - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- **Reserved** (1 & 3 years)
	- **Reserved Instances** - long workload
	- **Convertible Reserved Instances** - long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plans** (1 & 3 years) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- **Spot Instances** - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- **Dedicated Hosts** - book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Dedicated Instances** - no other customers will share your hardware
- **Capacity Reservations** - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

## On-Demand Instances
- Pay for what you use:
	- Linux of Windows: billing per second, after the first minute
	- All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment

- You reserve a specific instance attributes (**Instance Type**, **Region**, **Tenancy**, **OS**)
- **Reservation Period** - **1 year** (+ discount) or **3 years** (+++ discount)

## Savings Plans
- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72$% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)

## Capacity Reservations
- Reserve **On-Demand** instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- **No time commitment** (create/cancel anytime), **no billing discounts**
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

## Which Purchasing Option is Right for Me?
Let's take HardRock resort as an analogy!
- **On demand**: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved**: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- **Savings Plans**: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, ...)
- **Spot instances**: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms.You can get kicked out at any time
- **Dedicated Hosts**: We book an entire building of the resort
- **Capacity Reservations**: you book a room for a period with full price even you donâ€™t stay in it
