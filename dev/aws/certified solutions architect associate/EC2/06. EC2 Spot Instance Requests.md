- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Define **max spot price** and get the instance **while current spot price < max**
	- The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
	- If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 minutes grace period.
- Other strategy: **Spot Block**  
	- ‚Äúblock‚Äù spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions ‚Ä¢ In rare situations, the instance may be reclaimed
When to use:
- **Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures**
- **Not great for critical jobs or databases**

ü§î Spot Blocks are no longer available to new AWS customers since July 1st 2021 and not supported after December 31, 2022. It still "might" appear in the exam, so just a good to know (I guess).

### üí°
You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are **open**, **active**, or **disabled**.
Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances.
You must first cancel a Spot Request, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances.

## Spot Fleets

Ultimate way to save money!
- Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
	- Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone  
	- Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose  
	- Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
	- **lowestPrice**: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload)
	- **diversified**: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
	- **capacityOptimized**: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
	- **priceCapacityOptimized** (recommended): pools with highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads)
- **Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price**
