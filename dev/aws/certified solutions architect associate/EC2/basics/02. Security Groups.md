Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances.

- Security groups only contain **allow** rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

## Deeper Dive
- Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
- They regulate:
	- Access to Ports
	- Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
	- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

## Security Groups Good to know
- Can be attached to multiple instances. An instance can have multiple security groups too.
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
- **It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access**
- If your application is not accessible (`time out`), then it's a security group issue
- If your application gives a "`connection refused`" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
- All inbound traffic is **blocked** by default
- All outbound traffic is **authorized** by default

`Security Group 1` authorizes Security Group `1` and `2` as inbound traffic. That means that the EC2 instance with Security Group `1` and `2` are allowed to make an inbound request, but not the Security Group `3`.

## Classic Ports to know
- 22 = `SSH` (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = `FTP` (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 22 = `SFTP` (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = `HTTP` - access unsecured websites
- 443 = `HTTPS` - access secured websites
- 3389 = `RDS` (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into Windows instance
