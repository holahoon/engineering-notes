## Assign Roles to an Instance

We have learned that we can run an SSH command from our terminal from [[03. SSH Overview#Start SSH in MacOS]].
We can also run a built-in SSH command CloudShell from AWS by going into the instance and click `Connect`.

This will open up a CloudShell in a new browser tab.
If we run `aws iam list-users` in the command line, it will give us a message saying `You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".` NEVER EVER put in secret keys or anything like that directly into the shell, because anybody with access to this instance can just simply acquire the credentials.
Instead, 
## Provide credentials from IAM Roles
Go to IAM > Roles (create a role if none exists) and use this role to provide credentials to an instance. 
Go back to our running EC2 instance and click on Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role. In the Modify IAM role UI, select the role to use.
If we go back to the CloudShell and type in `aws iam list-users`, it will give back the specific IAM role we assigned to the instance.
