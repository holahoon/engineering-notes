## `io1` / `io2` family

- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
- Each instance has full read & write permissions to the high-performance volume
- Use case:
	- Achieve **higher application availability** in clustered Linux applications (ex:Teradata)
	- Applications must manage concurrent write operations
- **Up to 16 EC2 Instances at a time**
- Must use a file system thatâ€™s cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4, etc...)
