## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
- This works for Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, and Network Load Balancer
- For both CLB & ALB, the “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
- Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances
