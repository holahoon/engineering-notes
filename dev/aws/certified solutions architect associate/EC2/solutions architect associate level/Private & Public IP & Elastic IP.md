## Private vs Public IP

Networking has to sorts of IPs. IPv4 and IPv6:
- **IPv4**: `1.160.10.240` (basically 4 numbers)
- **IPv6 3ffe**: `1900:4545:4:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf` (less numbers with bunch of letters)

- IPv4 is still the most common format used online.  
- IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the Internet of Things (IoT).
- IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space
- IPv4: [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].

With public IP, accessible over the internet, but with private IP, it's only accessible within your private network.

- Public IP:  
	- Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)  
	- Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP).
	- Can be geo-located easily

- Private IP:
	- Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
	- The IP must be unique across the private network
	- BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPs.
	- Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
	- Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP

## Elastic IPs

- When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP.
- If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP
- An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you donâ€™t delete it
- You can attach it to one instance at a time

- With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. (*not common*)
- You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that).
- Overall, **try to avoid using Elastic IP:**  
	- They often reflect poor architectural decisions
	- Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it  
	- Or, as weâ€™ll see later, use a Load Balancer and donâ€™t use a public IP

## Private vs Public IP(IPv4) in AWS EC2 - hands on

- By default, your EC2 machine comes with: â€¢ A private IP for the internal AWS Network  
	- A public IP, for the WWW.
	- When we are doing SSH into our EC2 machines:  
- We canâ€™t use a private IP, because we are not in the same network
	- We can only use the public IP.
- If your machine is stopped and then started, **the public IP can change**

## Hands on

If we start/stop our EC2 instance, it will change its public IPv4 address. This will be a problem.
In this case, use Elastic IP addresses.
Go into EC2 > Network & Security / Elastic IPs. Click on Allocate Elastic IP address and allocate it.
This Elastic IP address can be allocated to a specific EC2 instance and it will keep the Elastic IP as long as it's attached.

ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind that Elastic IP address will be **charged if it is not attached**. So make sure to attach it ASAP.

### Associate Elastic IP address
So click on Actions > Associate Elastic IP address. Choose the `Instance` resource type, pick the instance that you want to attach to, and pick the private IP address. Now, click `Associate` button to associate it.
We can now see that our instance is connected to the Elastic IP address.

### Disassociate Elastic IP address

Go to Elastic IP address again and click on `Actions` > `Disassociate Elastic IP address`.
Make sure to Release the Elastic IP address so it doesn't run and get charged by click on `Actions` > `Release Elastic IP address`
