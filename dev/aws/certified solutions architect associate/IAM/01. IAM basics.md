## Users & Groups
IAM, Identity and Access Management, and it is a **Global** service.
- `Root` account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- `Users` are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- `Groups` only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple group

## Permission

![[Pasted image 20240205135731.png]]
- `Users` or `Groups` can be assigned JSON documents called `policies`
- These policies define the `permissions` of the users
- In AWS, you apply the **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs

## IAM Policies Inheritance

Pretty self-explanatory.

## IAM Policies Structure

Here's an example of the IAM policies structure:
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
			},
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:PutObject"
			],
			"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3::mybucket/*"]
		}
	]
}
```
- `Version`: Policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
- `Id`: an identifier for the policy (option)
- `Statement`: one ore more individual statements (required)
	- `Sid`: an identifier for the statement (optional)
	- `Effect`: Whether the statement allows or denies access (`Allow`, `Deny`)
	- `Principal`: `account` | `user` | `role` to which this policy applies to
	- `Action`: list of actions this policy allows or denies
	- `Resource`: list of resources to which the actions applied to
- `Condition`: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

## IAM Password Policy
- Strong passwords = higher security for your account
- In AWS, you can setup a password policy
	- Set a minimum password length
	- Require specific character types:
		- including uppercase letters
		- lowercase letters
		- number
		- non-alphanumeric characters
	- Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	- Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
	- Prevent password re-use

## Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
- **You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users**
- MFA = password *you know* + security device *you own*
- Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised

## AWS Access Key, CLI and SDK
- To access AWS, you have three options:
	- **AWS Management Console** (protected by password + MFA)
	- **AWS Command Line Interface**: protected by access keys
	- **AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)** - for code: protected by access keys
- Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
- Users manage their own access keys
- Access are secret, just like a password. Don't share them
- Treat AccessKey ID and Secrete Access Key just like your username and password

## [[02. Using AWS CLI]]

## IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will assign **permissions** to AWS services with **IAM Roles**
- Common roles:
	- EC2 Instance Roles
	- Lambda Function Roles
	- Roles for CloudFormation

## IAM Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report** (account-level)
	- a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- **IAM Access Advisor** (user-level)
	- access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
	- you can use this information to revise your policies

## IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- **Assign users to groups** and assign permissions to groups
- Create a **strong password policy**
- Use and enforce the use of **Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Create and use **Roles** for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

## Summary
- `Users`: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- `Groups`: contains users only
- `Policies`: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
- `Roles`: for EC2 instances or AWS services
- `Security`: MFA + Password Policy
- `AWS CLI`: manage your AWS services using the command-line interface
- `AWS SDK`: manage your AWS services using programming language
- `Access Keys`: access AWS using the CLI of SDK
- `Audit`: IAM Credentials Reports & IAM Access Advisor
