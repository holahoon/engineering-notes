- In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs associated with their bucket
- **With Requester Pays buckets**, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket
- Helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts
- The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)
