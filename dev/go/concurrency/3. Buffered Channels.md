Channels can be *buffered*. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to `make` to initialize a buffered channel:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

```go
func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
// 1
// 2
```

Let me explain Buffer channels in Go a bit more (asked GPT).

Buffered channels in Go allow you to set up "holding area" for messages, so that sending to and receiving from the channel doesn't always need to block immediately. Here's what happens when you use a buffered channel:
```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```
- `100` is the buffer length, or capacity, of the channel.
- The channel now has space to hold up to 100 values without needing a corresponding receiver.

The key differences with buffered channels is that
1. Sending to a **Buffered Channel**:
	- In an **unbuffered channel** (i.e., `ch := make(chan int)`), a send (`ch <- value`) blocks until another goroutine receives the value.
	- In a **buffered channel** (e.g., `ch := make(chan int, 100)`), a send only blocks if the channel is **full**.
		- You can send up to 100 values into `ch` without blocking in this case.
		- The 101<sup>st</sup> would block until space opens up in the buffer (i.e., a receiver occurs).
2. Receiving from a **Buffered Channel**:
	- In an **unbuffererd channel**, a receive (`<-ch`) blocks until there's a corresponding send.
	- In a **buffered channel**, a receive blocks only when the buffer is **empty**.
		- For example, if there are 10 values in a 100-capacity channel, a receive will take the first value without blocking.
Example:
```go
func main() {
	// Create a buffered channel with capacity of 3
	ch := make(chan int, 3)

	// Send three values to the channel without any receive
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	ch <- 3

	// Now the channel is full, and any further send will block
	// Uncommenting the next line would cause a deadlock if there's no receiver
	// ch <- 4 // this would block since buffer capactiy is reached

	// Receiving values
	fmt.Println(<-ch) // 1
	fmt.Println(<-ch) // 2
	fmt.Println(<-ch) // 3

	// Now the channel is empty, and any further receive would block
	// Uncommenting the next line would cause a deadlock if there's no sender
	// fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```

Buffered channels are helpful when:
- **Burst Handling**: You want to send a burst of data but don't want every send to wait for a corresponding receive. The buffer allows these sends to proceed immediately (until full).
- **Rate Limiting**: You want to control the rate at which values are processed. For example, a worker might pull items from the channel as it's ready, and the buffer ensures that bursts don't overwhelm the worker.
