The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.

A `select` blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It choose one at random if multiple are ready.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func fibonacci(c, quit chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for {
		select {
		case x <- x:
			x, y = y, x + y
		case <- quit:
			fmt.Println("quit")
			return
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	quit := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			fmt.Println(<-c)
		}
	}()

	fibonacci(c, quit)
}
// 0
// 1
// 1
// 2
// 3
// quit
```

## Break down
Basically, the `select` statement in Go is a control structure that lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations. It is useful for handling multiple channels simultaneously, as it allows the program to respond to whichever channel operation (send or receive) is ready first.

`fibanocci` function:
```go
func fibonacci(c, quit chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for {
		select {
		case c <- x:
			x, y = y, x + y
		case <- quit:
			fmt.Println("quit")
			return
		}
	}
}
```
1. Purpose of `select`:
	- Inside the infinite `for` loop, `select` is used to monitor two channels (`c` and `quit`) for readiness.
	- `select` will execute one of its `case` blocks based on which channel operation is ready first.
2. Case `c <- x`:
	- When the program is ready to send a value to `c`, the `select` will execute `c <- x`, placing the next Fibonacci number in the sequence on channel `c`.
	- After sending `x`, the variables `x` and `y` are updated to the next pair in the Fibonacci sequence (`x, y = y, x + y`).
3. Case `<-quit`:
	- If a signal is received from `quit`, `select` will execute this case.
	- The `fmt.Println("quit")` statement runs, printing "quit" to indicate the end of the Fibonacci generation.
	- The `return` statement terminates the `fibonacci` function, stopping the infinite loop and ending Fibonacci number generation.

`main` function:
```go
func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	quit := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++{
			fmt.Println(<- c)
		}
		quit <- 0
	}()
}
```
1. Anonymous Goroutine:
	- This goroutine is responsible for receiving and printing 5 Fibonacci numbers from the `c` channel.
	- After printing 10 numbers, it sends a signal to the `quit` channel (`quit <- 0`) to stop the fibonacci function.
2. Running `fibonacci` with `select`:
	- When `fibonacci(c, quit)` is called, it begins sending Fibonacci numbers to the `c` channel.
	- As soon as the anonymous goroutine receives and prints 5 numbers, it sends a value to the `quit` channel.
	- The `select` inside `fibonacci` detects the signal on `quit`, exits the function, and prints `"quit"` to signify the end of execution.

So in our code, `select` is crucial for monitoring both channels (`c` and `quit`) in the `fibonacci` function. It allows the function to:
- Continuously generate Fibonacci numbers by sending them on `c`.
- Stop generating numbers and exit gracefully when it receives a signal from `quit`.
This approach provides a clean way to handle multiple communication channels concurrently.
