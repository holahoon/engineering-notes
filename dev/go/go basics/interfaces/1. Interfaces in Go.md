[Interfaces](https://go.dev/tour/methods/9) are just collections of method signatures. A type "implements" an interface if it has methods that match the interface's method signatures.

In the following example, a "shape" must be able to return its area and perimeter. Both `rect` and `circle` fulfill the interface.

```go
type shape interface {
	area() float64
	perimeter() float64
}
type rect struct {
	width, height float64
}
func (r rect) area() float64 {
	return r.width * r.height
}
func (r rect) perimeter() float64 {
	return (2 * r.width) + (2 * r.height)
}

type circle struct {
	radius float64
}
func (c circle) area() float64 {
	return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c circle) perimeter() float64 {
	retur 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}
```

When a type implements an interface, it can then be used as that interface type.

```go
func printShapeData(s shape) {
	fmt.Printf("Index: %v - Area: %v - Perimeter: %v\n", i, s.area(), s.perimeter())
}
```

Because we say that input is of type `shape`, we know that any argument must implement the `.area()` and `.perimeter()` methods.

As an example, because the [empty interface](https://go.dev/tour/methods/14) doesn't require a type to have any methods at all, every type automatically implements the empty interface, written as:
```go
interface{}
```

Interfaces allow you to focus on what a type does rather than how it's built. They can help you write more flexible and reusable code by defining behaviors (like methods) that different types can share. This makes it easy to swap out or update parts of your code without changing everything else.
