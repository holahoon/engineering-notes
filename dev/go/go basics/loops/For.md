Go has only one looping construct, the `for` loop.
The basic `for` loop has three components separated by semicolons:

- the init statement: executed before the first iteration
- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the `for` statement.
The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to `false`.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
	sum := 0
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
	// 45
}
```

The init and post statements are optional.
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
	sum := 1
	for ; sum < 1000; {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
	// 1024
}
```
