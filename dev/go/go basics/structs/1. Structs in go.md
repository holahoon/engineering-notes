A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-blank field names must be unique.
We use structs in Go to represent structured data. It's often convenient to group different types of variables together. For example, if we want to represent a car we could do the following:
```go
type car struct {
	 brand string
	 model string
	 doors int
	 mileage int
	 frontWheel wheel
	 backWheel wheel
}
```

This creates a new struct type called `car`. All cars have a `brand`, `model`, `doors` and `mileage`.
Structs in Go are often used to represent data that you might use a dictionary or object for in other languages.

Here's another example
```go
package main
import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	vertes := Vertex{1,2}
	fmt.Println(vertex)
	// {1 2}
}
```

And the struct fields can be accessed using a dot.
```go
func main(){
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	fmt.Println(v.X)
	// 4
}
```
