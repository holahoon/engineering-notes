Structs can be nested to represent more complex entities:
```go
type car struct {
	brand string
	model string
	doors int
	frontWheel wheel
	backWheel wheel
}

type wheel struct {
	radius int
	material string
}
```

the fields of a struct can be accessed using the dot `.` operator.
```go
myCar := car{}
myCar.frontWheel.radius = 5
```
