An anonymous struct is just like a normal struct, but it is defined without a name and therefore cannot be referenced elsewhere in the code.

To create an anonymous struct, just instantiate the instance immediately using a second pair of brackets after declaring the type:
```go
myCar := struct {
	make string
	model string
} {
	make: "Tesla",
	model: "model 3",
}
```

You can even nest anonymous structs as fields within other structs:
```go
type car struct {
	make string
	model string
	doors int
	mileage int
	// wheel is a field containing an anonymous struct
	wheel struct {
		radius int
		material string
	}
}
```

## When should you use an anonymous struct?

In general, *prefer named structs*. Named structs make it easier to read and understand the code, and they have the nice side-effect of being reusable. Use anonymous structs when you *know* you won't ever need to use a struct again. For example, sometimes you'll use one to create the shape of some JSOn data in HTTP handlers.

If a struct is only meant to be used once, then it makes sense to declare it in such a way that developers down the road won't be tempted to accidentally use it again.
