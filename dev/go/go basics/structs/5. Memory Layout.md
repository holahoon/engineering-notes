In Go, structs sit in memory in a contiguous block, with fields placed one after another as defined in the struct. For example this struct:
```go
type stats struct {
	Reach uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}
```

Looks like this in memory:

## Field ordering... matters?

The order of the fields in a struct can have a big impact on memory usage. This is the same struct as above, but poorly designed:
```go
type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}
```

Looks like this in memory:

Notice that Go has "aligned" the fields, meaning that it has added some padding (wasted space) to make up for the size difference between the `uint16` and `uint8` types. It's done for execution speed, but it can lead to increased memory usage.

### Should I panic?

Well, you *should not stress* about [memory layout](https://go101.org/article/memory-layout.html). However, if you have a specific reason to be concerned about memory usage, aligning the fields by size (largest to smallest) can help. You can also use the [reflect package](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect) to debug the memory layout of a struct:
```go
typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes\n", typ.Size())
```

The author of this tutorial had a server in production that held *a lot* of structs in memory. Like *hundreds of thousands* in a list. When he re-ordered the fields in the struct, the memory usage of the program dropped by over 2 gigabytes which was a *huge* performance win!
