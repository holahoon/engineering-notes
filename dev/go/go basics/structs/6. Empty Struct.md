[Empty structs](https://dave.cheney.net/2014/03/25/the-empty-struct) are used in Go as a [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation) value.

Anonymous empty struct type
```go
empty := struct{}{}
```

Named empty struct type
```go
type emptyStruct struct{}
empty := emptyStruct{}
```

The cool thing about empty structs is that they're the smallest possible type in Go: they take up **zero bytes of memory**.

Surprisingly, empty structs are used very often, mostly with maps and channels.
