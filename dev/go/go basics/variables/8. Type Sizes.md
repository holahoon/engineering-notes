Integers, units, floats, and complex numbers all have type sizes.

### Whole Numbers (no decimal)
```go
int int8 int16 int32 int64
```

### Positive Whole Numbers (no decimal)
```go
uint uint8 uint16 uint 32 uintptr
```
Unsigned Integers are used when we know that the value that we are storing will always be non-negative (zero or positive) [ref](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/unsigned_integer.html#:~:text=Unsigned%20Integers,negative%20(zero%20or%20positive).)

### Signed Decimal Numbers
```go
float32 float64
```

### Imaginary Numbers (rarely used)
```go
complex64 complex128
```

## What's the deal with the sizes?

The size (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc) represents how many [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) in memory will be used to store the variable. The "default" `int` and `uint` types refer to their respective 32 or 64-bit sizes depending on the environment of the user.
The "standard" sizes that should be used unless you have a specific performance need (e.g. using less memory) are:
- `int`
- `uint`
- `float64`
- `complex128`

### We can convert between types

Some types can be easily converted like this:
```go
temperatureFloat := 88.26
temperatureInt := int64(temperatureFloat)
```
Casting a float to an integer in this way truncates the floating point portion.
