With so many types for what is essentially just a number, developers coming from languages that only have one kind of `Number` type (like JavaScript) may find the choices daunting.

## Prefer "default" types

A problem arises when we have a `uint64`, and the function we are trying to pass it into takes an `int`. We're forced to write code riddled with type conversions like:
```go
var myAge uint16 = 25
myAgeInt := int(myAge)
```

This style of code can be slow and annoying to read. When Go developers stray from the “default” type for any given type family, the code can get messy quickly. Unless you have a good _performance related_ reason, you'll typically just want to use the "default" types:
- `bool`
- `string`
- `int`
- `uint`
- `byte`
- `rune`
- `float64`
- `complex128`
## When to use a more specific type?

When you're super concerned about performance and memory usage.
That's about it.
