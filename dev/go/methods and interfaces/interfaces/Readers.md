The `io` package specifies the `io.Reader` interface, which represents the read end of a stream of data.

The Go standard library contains [many implementations](https://cs.opensource.google/search?q=Read%5C(%5Cw%2B%5Cs%5C%5B%5C%5Dbyte%5C)&ss=go%2Fgo) of this interface, including files, network connections, compressors, ciphers, an others.

The `io.Reader` interface has a `Read` method:
```go
func (T) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
```

`Read` populates the given byte slice with data and returns the number of bytes populated and an error value. It returns an `io.EOF` error when the stream ends.

The example code creates a `strings.Reader` and consumes its output 8 bytes at a time.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	r := strings.NewReader("Hello, Reader!")

	b := make([]byte, 8)
	for {
		n, err := r.Read(b)
		fmt.Printf("n = %v err = %v b = %v\n", n, err, b)
		fmt.Printf("b[:n] = %q\n", b[:n])
		if err == io.EOF {
			break
		}
	}
	// n = 8 err = <nil> b = [72 101 108 108 111 44 32 82]
	// b[:n] = "Hello, R"
	// n = 6 err = <nil> b = [101 97 100 101 114 33 32 82]
	// b[:n] = "eader!"
	// n = 0 err = EOF b = [101 97 100 101 114 33 32 82]
	// b[:n] = ""
}
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening.
### 1. Creating a Reader:
```go
r := strings.NewReader("Hello, Reader!")
```
- `strings.NewReader("Hello, Reader!")` creates a `Reader` that reads from the given string `("Hello Reader!")`, treating the string as a stream of data. This `Reader` implements the `io.Reader` interface, meaning it has a `Read` method that can be used to read data in chunks.
### 2. Creating a Byte Slice for Reading:
```go
b := make([]byte, 8)
```
- `b := make([]byte, 8)` creates a byte slice `b` with a length of 8 bytes, which will serve as a buffer for each chunk from the `Reader`.
- Each time `Read` is called, it will attempt to fill this buffer with up to 8 bytes from the `Reader`.

### 3. Reading in a loop:
```go
for {
	n, err := r.Read(b)
	...
	if err == io.EOF {
		break
	}
}
```
- This `for` loop reads chunks of data from `r` into `b` until there's no more data to read.
- `r.Read(b)` reads up to `len(b)` bytes (8 in this case) into `b`. It returns the number of bytes read (`n`) and an error (`err`).
- If `err` is `io.EOF`, it indicates that the end of the data has been reached, and the loop breaks.

### 4. Printing the Output:
```go
fmt.Printf("n = %v err = %v b = %v\n", n, err, b)
fmt.Printf("b[:n] = %q\n", b[:n])
```
- `fmt.Printf("n = %v err = %v b = %v\n", n, err, b)` prints the number of bytes read (`n`), any error encountered (`err`), and the contents of the buffer `b` (which may contain data beyond what was read, depending on previous reads).
- `fmt.Printf("b[:n] = %q\n", b[:n])` prints only the portion of `b` that was actually read (`b[:n]`). The `%q` verb prints the slice as a double-quoted string, which is easier to read.

## Example

Implement a `Reader` type that emits an infinite stream of the ASCII character `'A'`.

```go
package main

import "golang.org/x/tour/reader"

type MyReader struct{}

func (m MyReader) Read(p []byte) (int, error) {
	for i := range p {
		p[i] = 'A'
	}
	return len(p), nil
}

func main(){
	reader.Validate(MyReader{})
}
```
