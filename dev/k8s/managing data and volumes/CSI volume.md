CSI(Container Storage Interface) defines a standard interface for container orchestration systems(like Kubernetes) to expose arbitrary storage systems to their container workloads.
It basically allows you to attach any storage solutions as long as they support integrations (like [AWS EFS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html)).
