Python has a different syntax from JavaScript ðŸ¤”

Here are some logical operators:
- and
- or
- not

The below is true since 1 is less than 2 is less than 3.
```python
1 < 2 < 3
# True
```

We can also write this in using logical operators:
```python
1 < 2 and 2 < 3
# True
```
This is much more readable.

example 2.
```python
1 < 3 and 3 > 2
# True
```

```python
1 == 2 or 2 < 3
# True
```

There's also the `not`.
```python
1 == 1
# True

not 1 == 1
# False

not 400 > 5000
# True
```

Also:
```python
12 != 12
# False

not 12 != 12
# True
```
